# Tram's custom DOORS entities
My custom DOORS entities, these currently include:
## Follow
Around Rush's speed, medium hitbox, does not rebound, flickers lights for 3 seconds, doesn't break lights, emits a humming sound and whispers (basically a quieter rush)

## Static
Fast, large hitbox, rebounds 3-9 times, flickers lights for 2 seconds, breaks lights, emits a static sound (basically a ripoff of Ambush)
